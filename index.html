        <p>My name is Erin, and I live in St Louis, MO and I'm learning to code. This page is a chance for me to 
            learn somethings and tell you a little about my family. I was born in St Louis and I've lived here almost
            my whole life -- I spent 4 years at Syracuse University getting my degree. I started college set on
            becoming a photojournalist but graduated realizing that wasn't the life for me.</p>
        <p>I still loved photography so I applied for commercial photographer positions and was hired to be the 
            in-house photographer for a ready-to-assemble furniture company. Through a variety of business and financial
            twists and turns I ended up art directing and managing more photographs than I actually took there. I also 
            began assiting the graphic designers when they needed help and slowly earned a position as a graphic designer.</p>
        <p>Now I'm working for an Office Supply Company as a Senior Graphic Designer and taking this awesome LC101 class
            so I can learn how to code. Way back in high school I did some html classes and really enjoyed it. I worked
            on a big website overhaul at work and I just had to learn more about what the developers were talking about,
            so here I am, learning!</p>

        <p>This is where copy about James will go. He went to lots of schools, likes cars, computers, watches, and video
            games. He does computer things and also inspired me to take this class so I can understand what he is talking about
            more of the time. I dont see tht happening any time soon.</p>
