            <p>My name is Erin, and I live in St Louis, MO and I&#39;m learning to code in LaunchCode&#39;s LC101.
                This page is a chance for me to learn some things and tell you a little about my family.  
                I&#39;m from St Louis, I&#39;m a graphic designer by day and excited to make pretty, functional 
                things on the internet. We are doing more web-based projects at work and that is part of 
                why I wanted to take this class - so I can have a better understanding of how these things work. </p>

            <p>This is my husband, James. He&#39;s pretty awesome. He is from St Louis and Belleville. He does computer 
                programming type things (that are way over my head) by day. He loves cars and fancy watches and
                tech toys. James is another reason why I wanted to take this class, I&#39;m hoping I can understand 
                some of his work a little more when he is talking about it after this class.</p>

            <p>This is Rene, she is a super-mutt and we love her. We adopted her 4 years ago and we think is about 
            7-8 years old. She is the most vocal dog I&#39;ve ever met. She grunts, groans, grumbles, sings, 
            and harumphs. Sometimes we call her saxaphone dog when she gets to singing.</p>

            <p>This is Frieda, she&#39;s probably mostly beagle. We adopted her a little over a year ago, and that would make her <i>allegedly</i> 4 years old, 
                I think she is much younger because she acts like a puppy. She is our cuddle bug and wants nothing more
                than to play catch or sleep in bed with us under a blanket.
